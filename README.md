The Angl Programming Language
===

Angl is a project for Gang Garrison 2, to help us escape from Game Maker and also run inside the web browser.

This repository is the result of merging two separate repositories: the parser and the compiler.

In the future this README may be more descriptive.  Until then, check out:

* the [parser's README](./parser/README.md)
* the [compiler's README](./compiler/README.md)
* The [wiki](https://github.com/gg2-angl/angl/wiki)
